# Air Quality Analysis and Forecasting

## Objective
The objective of the project is to study the seasonality and the meteorological reasons behind the air pollution in Delhi. Moreover, we have experimented with a few machine learning based models to forecast the trend observed in the Air quality index.

## Dataset
The dataset contains air quality data and AQI (Air Quality Index) at hourly and daily intervals of various stations across multiple cities in India. The data has been made publicly available by the [Central Pollution Control Board](https://cpcb.nic.in/) which is the official portal of the Government of India. The compiled dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india).

Download the dataset and extract it out into the `air-quality-dataset` folder.
